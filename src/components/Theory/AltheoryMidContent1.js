              An Algebraic identity is an equality, which is true for all values
              of the variables in the equality.
            </li>
            <li>
              The algebraic equations which are valid for all values of
              variables in them are called algebraic identities.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this way, algebraic identities are used in the computation of
              algebraic expressions and solving different polynomials
            </li>
            <li>
              Algebraic identities are also used for the factorization of
              polynomials.

            A square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four
            equal sides and four equal angles of 90 degrees each.
